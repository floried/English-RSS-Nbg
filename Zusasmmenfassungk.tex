\section{Globalisation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{Definition}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Globalisation is the worldwide rapid spread and exchange of raw materials, goods and services, ideas, information and values, culture and languages, labour resources and money due to the development of the Internet including online-banking and faster, better and cheaper means of communication, production and transport. \\
		The world is gradually becoming unified on an economic, cultural and technological level. \\
		It includes the increasing mobility of people such as tourists, business people and immigrants due to easier, cheaper and faster means of transport and fewer border restrictions.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Benefits of globalisation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Economies of countries grow much faster
		\item improve living standards and reduce poverty
		\item increased life expectancy
		\item positive environmental (=Bewusstsein) outcomes
		\item enabled international political and economic tensions to be resolved bolstered peace
		\item Improved technology has dramatically reduced costs and prices
		\item modern communication growth in liberal democracies
		\item workspace standards
		\item respect for cultural identities
		\item combating crime \textrightarrow Interpol
		\item GDP (=BIP) increased twice as much as before. 
		\item averange income has increased
		\item competition on even platform / on a single global platform
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Problems of globalisation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item social and economic costs, living standards dropped
		\item gap between rich and poor is widening
		\item facilitated the spread of human, animal and plant diseases
		\item introduction of cigarettes and tobacco, major adverse health and financial costs
		\item more vulnerable to economic problems
		\item environment has been harmed (e.g. Monsanto, GM-crops, destroying biodiversity)
		\item work against the interests of the developing world
		\item technological improvements destroying traditional agricultural communities
		\item Modern communications increased the demand for migration (to richer countries) 
		\item \glq brain drain\grq\ of skilled workers
		\item indigenous and national culture and languages can be eroded (\textrightarrow=Erosion)
		\item Wealth is still concentrated in the hands of a few individuals
		\item incoming gap between developed and developing countries
		\item impossible to reverse
